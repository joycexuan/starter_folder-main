This repository contains an analysis that explores the number of assaults in Toronto neighbourhoods. I explored a dataset from Open Data Portal Toronto that was collected and published by The Toronto Police Services. I focused on the neighbourhoods with the top five number of assaults in 2020 and 2021, and then the Church-Yonge Corridor neighbourhood in particular, and how this information is relevant to increasing safety measures and police surveillance to improve the neighbourhoods' wellbeing.
